    <p>This Google Sheets Add-on is for Proulex Teachers (<a href="https://www.proulex.com" title="PROULEX.COM" target="_blank" class="w3-hover-text-green">www.proulex.com</a>). Teachers can use it to share individual test results with virtual students.
    </p> 

    <img src="assets/ProulexTools250px.png" alt="Logo for Proulex Tools"/>

    <p>In Proulex, we give virtual students Speax Progress Tests through Google Forms. Once students finish the tests and the teacher grades them, it's nice to review the results with students in class, but <u>what's the easiest method to share them with virtual students?</u>
    </p>

    <p>Using the Proulex Tools Add-on for Google Sheets, you can generate individual student PDF files to share with your virtual students. With one click, the Add-on creates URL's (links) for each student. Then you send the URL's to each individual via WhatsApp.

The PDF files will be stored in your Google Drive in a folder with the same name as your Google Sheet. You can share these PDF files with your students by copying URLs from the "Student Reports" sheet which is created by the Add-on when it runs.
